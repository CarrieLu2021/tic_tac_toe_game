# tic_tac_toe_game
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbol (either "X" or "O"). The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all the positions on the board are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie. 
This implementation of the game in Python allows two players to play the game in the console, and includes error handling for invalid inputs and an option to play again after the game is finished.
